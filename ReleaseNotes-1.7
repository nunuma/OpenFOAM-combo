* Overview
  OpenFOAM-1.7.x is the latest release of OpenFOAM that contains new features
  both from OpenCFD's development version of OpenFOAM and the repository 1.6.x
  distribution.  This release passes our standard tests and the tutorials have
  been broadly checked.  Please report any bugs by following the link:
  http://www.openfoam.com/bugs.

* GNU/Linux version
  This release of OpenFOAM is distributed primarily in 2 ways: (1) as a Debian
  pack containing binaries and source; (2) from the SourceForge source code
  repository (see [[./README][README]]).

  The Ubuntu/Debian pack is available for 32 and 64 bit versions of the 10.04
  LTS operating system using the system compiler and libraries that will be
  installed automatically from standard Debian packs.

  To use the source version from the SourceForge repository, we provide a source
  pack of third-party packages that can be compiled on the user's system.  This
  does not include =gcc=, since the system installed version is typically
  sufficient, but includes =paraview-3.8.0=, =openmpi-1.4.1=, =scotch_5.1=,
  =metis-5.0pre2=, =ParMetis-3.1= and =ParMGridGen-1.0=.

* Library developments
  There have been a number of developments to the libraries to support the
  extension of functionality in solver and utility applications.
*** Core library
    + Large number of code refinements and consistency improvements to support
      other developments.
*** Turbulence modelling
    + Wall function boundary conditions:
      + *New* =mutWallFunction= continuous wall function,
      + *New* =mutLowReWallFunction= continuous wall function,
      + *New* =nutWallFunction= continuous wall function,
      + *New* =nutLowReWallFunction= continuous wall function,
      + Standard wall functions, based on k, now renamed  =nutkWallFunction= and
        =mutkWallFunction=
      + =omegaWallFunction= now includes laminar blending function.
    + Conjugate heat transfer boundary conditions:
      + *New* =turbulentTemperatureCoupledBaffleMixed= BC,
      + *New* =turbulentTemperatureCoupledBaffle=  BC.
*** Thermo-physical Models
    There has been a set of developments to redefine the thermodynamics in some
    solvers in terms of sensible enthalpy instead of total (i.e. including
    chemical) enthalpy.  This was done to improve the handling of
    thermodynamics in the case of partially-premixed or non-premixed combustion
    systems, or to handle systems with non-unity Lewis number.
    + *New* =hsPsiThermo= thermophysical model calculation based on sensible
       enthalpy =hs= and compressibility =psi=.
    + *New* =hsRhoThermo= thermophysical model calculation based on =hs= and
      density =rho=.
    + *New* =hsCombustionThermo= thermophysical model calculation for a
      combustion mixture based on =hs= and =psi=.
    + *New* =hsPsiMixtureThermo= thermophysical model calculation for a
      mixture based on =hs= and =psi=.
    + *New* =hsReactionThermo= thermophysical model calculation for a complex
      reacting mixture based on =hs=.
*** DSMC
    + 1D and 2D planar simulations now possible by specifying empty patches in
      the usual way.
    + *New* =MixedDiffuseSpecular= wall boundary condition added.
    + *New* pressure field measurement.
    + *New* measurement of velocity slip and temperature jump.
*** Dynamic Mesh
    + *New* =sixDoFRigidBodyDisplacement= six degree-of-freedom, fluid coupled
      rigid body motion, applied as a boundary condition to a patch in the
      pointDisplacement field for dynamic mesh cases.  The motion may have any
      number of restraints (springs and dampers) and constraints (reductions in
      degrees-of-freedom) applied. Restraints include
      =linearAxialAngularSpring=, =linearSpring=, =sphericalAngularSpring= and
      =tabulatedAxialAngularSpring=.
      Constraints include =fixedAxis=, =fixedLine=, =fixedOrientation=,
      =fixedPlane= and =fixedPoint=.
*** Numerics
    + MULES now supports sub-cycling on moving meshes for interface capturing
      VoF (volume of fluid) calculations.
    + Developments to =TimeActivatedExplicitSource=, a class that allows a
      source to be applied to an equation according to an input dictionary at
      run-time, that can be switched on at particular times and within
      particular regions of the mesh, using =cellZones=.

* Solvers
  A number of new solvers have been developed for a range of engineering
  applications.  There has been a set of improvements to certain classes of
  solver that are introduced in this release.
*** *New* Solvers
    + =fireFoam=: Transient solver for fires and turbulent diffusion flames.
    + =rhoPorousMRFPimpleFoam=: Transient solver for laminar or turbulent flow
      of compressible fluids with support for porous media and MRF for HVAC and
      similar applications.  Uses the flexible PIMPLE (PISO-SIMPLE) solution for
      time-resolved and pseudo-transient simulations.
    + =chtMultiRegionSimpleFoam=: Steady-state version of =chtMultiRegionFoam=.
    + =porousSimpleFoam=: Steady-state solver for incompressible, turbulent
      flow with implicit or explicit porosity treatment.
    + =interMixingFoam=: Solver for 3 incompressible fluids, two of which are
      miscible, using a VoF method to capture the interface.
    + =porousInterFoam=: Solver for 2 incompressible, isothermal immiscible
      fluids using a VoF phase-fraction based interface capturing approach.
    + =simpleWindFoam=: Steady-state solver for incompressible, turbulent flow
      with external source in the momentum equation to approximate, e.g. wind
      turbines; located in tutorials, with associated =turbineSiting= test
      case.
*** Modifications to multiphase and buoyant solvers
    + Multiphase and buoyant flow solvers now solve for =p_rgh= = =p - rho*g.h=,
      rather than the static pressure =p=.  This change is to avoid deficiencies
      in the handling of the pressure force / buoyant force balance on
      non-orthogonal and distorted meshes.
    + Improvements to boundary conditions and pressure referencing in closed
      domains have been developed to avoid the problems encountered in previous
      attempts to decompose pressure for buoyant flow.
    + The following solvers have been modified for =p_rgh=: =fireFoam=
      =buoyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam=, =buoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoam=,
      =buoyantPimpleFoam=, =buoyantSimpleFoam=, =chtMultiRegionFoam=,
      =chtMultiRegionSimpleFoam=, =compressibleInterDyMFoam=,
      =compressibleInterFoam=, =interDyMFoam=, =porousInterFoam=,
      =MRFInterFoam=, =interFoam=, =interPhaseChangeFoam=,
      =multiphaseInterFoam=, =settlingFoam=, =twoLiquidMixingFoam=.
*** Modifications to solvers for sensible enthalpy
    + The following solvers have been modified to solve for =hs= (instead of
      =h=): =dieselEngineFoam=, =dieselFoam=, =reactingFoam=,
      =rhoReactingFoam=, =coalChemistryFoam=,
      =porousExplictSourceReactingParcelFoam=, =reactingParcelFoam=.
*** Modifications to steady-state compressible solvers
    + Boundedness to the thermodynamics is ensured by limiting the density,
      rather than the pressure.  This improves convergence by maintaining
      consistency between the pressure gradient and momentum changes
    + Removed the Sp "boundedness" correction in the convection term from the
      momentum equation.
    + The following solvers have been modified with this change:
      =rhoSimpleFoam=, =buoyantSimpleFoam=, =chtMultiRegionSimpleFoam=
*** Other modifications
    + Added diffusion number limit to the time-step correction in
      =chtMultiRegionFoam=.
    + Reformulated pressure correction during phase change to maintain
      boundedness of pressure in =cavitatingFoam=.

* Boundary conditions
  New boundary conditions have been introduced to support new applications in
  OpenFOAM.
  + Added new time varying boundary conditions.
  + Added new velocity inlets and wall boundary conditions:
    =cylindricalInletVelocity=, =swirlFlowRateInletVelocity=,
    =translatingWallVelocity=.
  + Added boundary conditions for wind/atmospheric simulation:
    =atmBoundaryLayerInletEpsilon=, =atmBoundaryLayerInletVelocity=,
    =fixedShearStress=.

* Utilities
  There have been some utilities added and updated in this release.
*** *New* utilities
    + =foamToTecplot360=: Tecplot binary file format writer.
    + =IFCLookUpTableGen=: Infinitely-fast chemistry (IFC) look-up table
      generator that calculates the infinitely-fast chemistry relationships as a
      function of =ft= for a given fuel.
*** Updated utilities
    + =gmshToFoam=: adapted for msh2.1 and 2.2 format.
    + =snappyHexMesh=: lower memory usage by pre-balancing and non-blocking
      transfers.
    + =blockMesh=: proper spline edges.
    + =setSet=: handling of faceZoneSet, cellZoneSet, pointZoneSet.
    + =splitMeshRegions=: option to use existing cellZones only for split.
    + =changeDictionary=: allow wildcards in changeDictionaryDict.

* Post-processing
  Post-processing has been extended particularly to function objects, the
  on-the-fly post-processing system.
  + *New* =fieldValues= function object, allows spatial averaging, sum,
      min/max calculations to be made on fields in sets of cells or faces in the
      geometry
  + *New* =surfaceInterpolateFields= function object to generate surface fields
      from volume fields where required
  + *New* =sampledTriSurfaceMesh= surface type for surface sampling function
    object
  + *New* =readFields= function object controls the loading of fields from time
      directories for further post-processing
