= Introduction =
This OpenFOAM-combo repository was created following the instructions written by Mark Olsen here: [http://olesenm.github.io/2009/11/24/merging-OpenFOAM-versions/ Merging OpenFOAM versions in git]

The objective is to have a single repository where all official OpenFOAM git repositories are tracked in a single repository, since this allows one to make it easier to keep track of changes made between versions.
